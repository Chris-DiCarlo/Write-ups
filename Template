## 1) Objective
- What is the goal of this exercise?
- Example: Enumerate the target, gain initial access, escalate privileges, and retrieve flags; or build detections for a simulated attack chain.

---

## 2) Tools Used
- Kali, Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Hydra, Netcat, Wfuzz, Hashcat  
- Wireshark, SIEM (Splunk/Azure Sentinel/Elastic), Cisco Talos, MITRE ATT&CK

---

## 3) Methodology / Steps Taken
- Outline your process and reasoning; include commands and key outputs.

Example commands:
```bash
nmap -sV -p- 10.10.10.5
wfuzz -c -z file,wordlists/common.txt --hc 404 http://target/FUZZ
```

---

## 4) Findings & Results
- What did you discover or accomplish?
- Example: Identified vulnerable Apache module → exploited RCE → captured user/root flags; or created detections that successfully triggered on TTPs.

**Evidence highlights**
- Service/version findings:
- Exploit path / detection logic summary:
- Credentials / artifacts recovered:

---

## 5) Skills Applied & Learned
- Enumeration & service fingerprinting
- Exploitation / PrivEsc (Linux/Windows)
- Detection engineering (KQL/SPL/ESQL), log analysis
- Incident handling & documentation
- ATT&CK mapping and hypothesis-driven hunting

---

## 6) Lessons Learned / Teaching Points
- Key takeaways you’d teach someone else.
- Example bullets:
  - Thorough enumeration before exploitation saves time.
  - Validate findings with multiple tools.
  - Map actions to **MITRE ATT&CK** to connect red ↔ blue perspectives.

---

## 7) Next Steps / Improvements
- What would you refine, automate, or research next?
- Example:
  - Automate baseline enumeration with a script.
  - Add SIEM correlation rules & dashboards for this TTP.
  - Explore alternate exploit chains / hardening steps.

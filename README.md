# Write-ups

Welcome to my repository of security write-ups. This collection highlights my hands-on work across both **red team** (offensive) and **blue team** (defensive) domains. The purpose of these write-ups is to:  

- Document my learning journey through penetration testing labs, HackTheBox modules, and defensive exercises.  
- Demonstrate the ability to **analyze, execute, and explain** complex security concepts.  
- Provide **teachable material** that others can learn from, while showing my technical depth.  
- Build a portfolio that reflects practical experience in **Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and Pentesting**.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Frameworks  

Throughout these labs, I work with a wide range of security tools and frameworks, including but not limited to:  

- **Offensive (Red Team)**  
  - Kali Linux, Metasploit Framework, Nmap, Burp Suite  
  - Hydra, Netcat, Wfuzz, Hashcat  

- **Defensive (Blue Team)**

## ðŸ“‚ Write-Ups  

Each lab or exercise has its own subpage. The write-ups follow a consistent format that includes objectives, methodology, tools used, skills demonstrated, and lessons learned.

## ðŸš€ Purpose  

These write-ups are designed to:  

- Showcase **hands-on technical ability** across attack and defense.  
- Provide **clear and professional documentation** for each exercise.  
- Highlight **continuous learning and skill development** in cybersecurity.  
- Demonstrate readiness for both **individual contributor** and **team lead/manager** positions in security operations and incident response.
